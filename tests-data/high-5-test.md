| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| 1 | Strongly Disagree | Does not resonate at all; completely disagrees |
| 2 | Disagree | Somewhat disagrees; rarely applies |
| 3 | Neutral/Unsure | Neither agrees nor disagrees; sometimes applies |
| 4 | Agree | Somewhat agrees; often applies |
| 5 | Strongly Agree | Strongly resonates; almost always applies |

## **Scoring Logic & Algorithms**

### **Step 1: Calculate Average Score for Each Strength**

The HIGH5 test uses a proprietary algorithm that analyzes response patterns across all 120 questions. Each of the 20 strengths is measured through approximately 6 questions distributed throughout the test.

**Important Note:** The exact question-to-strength mapping is proprietary to HIGH5. For implementation purposes, questions should be mapped to strengths based on content alignment with strength definitions.

**Calculation Formula:**

Strength\_Raw\_Score \= (Q\_a \+ Q\_b \+ Q\_c \+ Q\_d \+ Q\_e \+ Q\_f) / 6

Where Q\_a through Q\_f are the 6 questions that measure that particular strength.

**Raw Score Range:** 1.00 to 5.00 per strength

### **Step 2: Normalize Scores to 0-100 Scale**

Convert raw averages to a 0-100 scale for standardization:

Normalized\_Score \= ((Raw\_Score \- 1\) / (5 \- 1)) × 100  
Normalized\_Score \= ((Raw\_Score \- 1\) / 4\) × 100

**Formula Breakdown:**

* **Minimum input (raw):** 1.00 (all responses \= 1\)  
* **Maximum input (raw):** 5.00 (all responses \= 5\)  
* **Output range:** 0-100

**Examples:**

* Raw score 1.00 → ((1-1)/4) × 100 \= 0  
* Raw score 3.00 → ((3-1)/4) × 100 \= 50  
* Raw score 5.00 → ((5-1)/4) × 100 \= 100

### **Step 3: Round to Whole Numbers**

Round each normalized score to the nearest integer (0-100):

Final\_Score \= Round(Normalized\_Score, 0\)

**Rounding Convention:** Standard rounding (0.5 rounds up)

### **Step 4: Rank All 20 Strengths**

Sort all 20 strengths by their normalized scores in descending order:

Ranked\_Strengths \= Sort(All\_Strengths, by: Normalized\_Score, order: DESC)

### **Step 5: Identify Top 5 Strengths**

Select the top 5 strengths from the ranked list:

Top\_5\_Strengths \= Ranked\_Strengths\[1:5\]

These represent the individual's **HIGH5** \- their most dominant natural strengths.

### **Step 6: Categorize Results into Focus, Leverage, and Navigate**

Based on HIGH5 methodology:

* **FOCUS (Ranks 1-5):** Top 5 strengths \- most powerful, should be used daily  
* **LEVERAGE (Ranks 6-10):** Supporting strengths \- situational, use when needed  
* **NAVIGATE (Ranks 11-15):** Neutral strengths \- don't come naturally, use selectively  
* **AVOID (Ranks 16-20):** Weakest areas \- minimize or delegate

## **Key Implementation Notes**

1. **Question Presentation:** All 120 questions should be presented in the order listed (Q1-Q120) to maintain test validity and prevent pattern recognition.

2. **Progress Saving:** Save responses to localStorage after each question to allow multi-session completion.

3. **Scoring Algorithm:** While the exact HIGH5 proprietary algorithm is not public, implementers should:

   * Map questions to strengths based on content alignment  
   * Calculate average scores for each strength  
   * Normalize to 0-100 scale  
   * Rank all 20 strengths  
   * Identify top 5  
4. **Score Interpretation:**

   * **85-100:** Exceptionally strong \- dominant characteristic  
   * **70-84:** Strong \- frequently demonstrated  
   * **55-69:** Moderate \- situational strength  
   * **40-54:** Low \- not a natural strength  
   * **0-39:** Very low \- likely a weakness  
5. **Domain Balance:** Note the distribution of top 5 strengths across domains to understand if someone is balanced or heavily weighted toward specific approaches (Doing, Feeling, Motivating, or Thinking).
